Initial Tree:
    20
   /  \
 10    40
      /  \
    30    50

*) Process:
- Insert the value into the tree following the BST properties. If it > then parent, go right, if it is < the parent, go left.
- Check the balance factor of each internal node, starting with the parent of the newly inserted node. 
- If imbalance occurs, check what type of imbalance it is, correct it and check for imbalance again utill the entire tree is balanced.
    - For LL imbalance, apply RR rotation 
    - For LR imbalance, apply LR rotation 
    - For RR imbalance, apply LL rotation 
    - For RL imbalance, apply RL rotation 

*) Height after insertion is 3.

*) Inserting 15:
1. 15 < 20, go left
2. 15 > 10, go right

    20
   /  \
 10    40
   \   / \
   15 30 50

3. Compute the balance factors:
BF(10)= 0 – 1 = –1
BF(40)= 1 – 1 = 0
BF(20) = 2 – 2 =0

The Tree is still balanced.
